## Getting a Standard Brain Atlas

Atlases are downloaded during [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov) installation.
To find the location of the atlases run `afni_system_check.py -check_all | grep
atlas`. If the atlases were not downloaded; download them from [this
link](https://bit.ly/3BpKN2K). Once the tarball has been extracted and placed
into whichever location the afni binaries are stored in, they are immediately
available for use.
